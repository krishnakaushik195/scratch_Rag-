RAG From Scratch: Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation App

ðŸ“– Overview
Welcome to RAG From Scratch! This project is designed to help you build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app from the ground up, providing a deeper understanding of how to leverage RAG for intelligent information retrieval and response generation.

RAG combines the power of information retrieval with large language models (LLMs) to generate highly relevant and context-aware answers. It uses indexing, retrieval, and generation to retrieve context from a document and produce responses based on that context.

In this project, youâ€™ll learn how to:

Index documents with embeddings.
Retrieve relevant documents based on similarity search.
Generate meaningful responses using LLMs.
