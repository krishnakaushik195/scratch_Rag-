RAG From Scratch: A Comprehensive Guide
This repository demonstrates how to implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) from scratch. RAG is a powerful approach to combine document retrieval with language generation using pre-trained models like GPT, making it a valuable tool for applications such as answering questions based on large document collections.

Project Overview
This project is divided into three primary stages:

Indexing 📚
This stage involves loading documents, splitting them into manageable chunks, and embedding them using pre-trained models.

Retrieval 🔍
The retrieval process identifies relevant document chunks based on the similarity between the input query and the stored document embeddings.

Generation 💡
Finally, the retrieved document chunks are combined with a query to generate a coherent, informative response using a language model.

How the Process Works
1. Indexing 📚
Indexing is the first and crucial step where we:

Load documents from the web or local files.
Split these documents into smaller chunks (to make retrieval efficient).
Embed the chunks using a model like OpenAIEmbeddings, which transforms text into high-dimensional vectors for similarity search.
Check out the code in Indexing_📚.py for more details.

2. Retrieval 🔍
Once the documents are indexed, retrieval involves:

Finding the most relevant document chunks based on a query.
Using cosine similarity or other techniques to compare the query embedding with the document embeddings.
Refer to the Retrieval_🔍.py file for the complete retrieval process.

3. Generation 💡
After relevant documents are retrieved, we:

Pass the document chunks and the query into a language model (like GPT-3.5).
The model generates a response based on the provided context.
See how this works in Generation_💡.py.

Files and Directories
Indexing_📚.py
This file handles document loading, splitting, and embedding.

Retrieval_🔍.py
This script is responsible for retrieving the most relevant document chunks based on a similarity search.

Generation_💡.py
This script connects the retrieved documents with the language model to generate responses.

full.py
A combined version of the entire RAG process (Indexing + Retrieval + Generation). This script runs the whole pipeline in one go.

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install langchain_community tiktoken langchain-openai langchainhub chromadb langchain
API Keys
Set your environment variables for API access. Add the following lines to your Python environment or a .env file:
python
Copy code
import os
os.environ['LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2'] = 'true'
os.environ['LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT'] = 'https://api.smith.langchain.com'
os.environ['LANGCHAIN_API_KEY'] = '<your-api-key>'
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = '<your-openai-api-key>'
How to Run
Indexing
Start by running the Indexing_📚.py file to load and index your documents.

bash
Copy code
python Indexing_📚.py
Retrieval
Run the Retrieval_🔍.py file to retrieve relevant document chunks based on your input query.

bash
Copy code
python Retrieval_🔍.py
Generation
Use the Generation_💡.py file to pass your query and retrieved documents into the language model for response generation.

bash
Copy code
python Generation_💡.py
Full Pipeline
Alternatively, you can run the entire pipeline in one go using the full.py script.

bash
Copy code
python full.py
Conclusion
This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of RAG and how it can be implemented from scratch. By separating the process into Indexing, Retrieval, and Generation, we ensure modularity and a clear understanding of each component. Feel free to explore the individual scripts or run the entire pipeline!

Happy Coding!
