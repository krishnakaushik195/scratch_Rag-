# **RAG From Scratch: A Comprehensive Guide**

This repository demonstrates how to implement **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) from scratch. RAG is a powerful approach to combine **document retrieval** with **language generation** using pre-trained models like GPT, making it a valuable tool for applications such as answering questions based on large document collections.

## **Project Overview**

This project is divided into three primary stages:

1. **Indexing** 📚  
   This stage involves loading documents, splitting them into manageable chunks, and embedding them using pre-trained models.

2. **Retrieval** 🔍  
   The retrieval process identifies relevant document chunks based on the similarity between the input query and the stored document embeddings.

3. **Generation** 💡  
   Finally, the retrieved document chunks are combined with a query to generate a coherent, informative response using a language model.

## **How the Process Works**

### 1. **Indexing** 📚

Indexing is the first and crucial step where we:
- Load documents from the web or local files.
- Split these documents into smaller chunks (to make retrieval efficient).
- Embed the chunks using a model like `OpenAIEmbeddings`, which transforms text into high-dimensional vectors for similarity search.

Check out the code in [`Indexing_📚.py`](./Indexing_📚.py) for more details.

### 2. **Retrieval** 🔍

Once the documents are indexed, retrieval involves:
- Finding the most relevant document chunks based on a query.
- Using cosine similarity or other techniques to compare the query embedding with the document embeddings.

Refer to the [`Retrieval_🔍.py`](./Retrieval_🔍.py) file for the complete retrieval process.

### 3. **Generation** 💡

After relevant documents are retrieved, we:
- Pass the document chunks and the query into a language model (like GPT-3.5).
- The model generates a response based on the provided context.

See how this works in [`Generation_💡.py`](./Generation_💡.py).

## **Files and Directories**

- **`Indexing_📚.py`**  
   This file handles document loading, splitting, and embedding.

- **`Retrieval_🔍.py`**  
   This script is responsible for retrieving the most relevant document chunks based on a similarity search.

- **`Generation_💡.py`**  
   This script connects the retrieved documents with the language model to generate responses.

- **`full.py`**  
   A combined version of the entire RAG process (Indexing + Retrieval + Generation). This script runs the whole pipeline in one go.
